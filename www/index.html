        <strong><i>TileStache</i> is a Python-based server application that can
        serve up map tiles based on rendered geographic data.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        You might be familiar with <a
        href="http://tilecache.org">TileCache</a>, the venerable open source
        WMS server from MetaCarta. TileStache is similar, but we hope simpler
        and better-suited to the needs of designers and cartographers.

    <h2>Features</h2>
    
    <p>
        Things TileStache does now:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Renders <a href="http://mapnik.org/">Mapnik</a> maps</li>
        <li>Caches to disk</li>
        <li>Serves tiles in Google-style spherical mercator projection and WGS84 lat/lon projection</li>
        <li>Runs from CGI, mod_python, or <a href="http://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn">gunicorn</a> WSGI</li>
        <li>Uses metatiles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Things TileStache might do in the near future:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Render <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a> datasources</li>
        <li>Cache to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    
    <p>
        The design of TileStache focuses on approachability at the expense of
        cleverness or completeness. Our hope is to make it easy for anyone to
        design a new map of their city, publish a fresh view of their world, or
        even build the next <a href="http://8bitnyc.com">8-Bit NYC</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Small</h3>

    <p>
        The core of TileStache is intended to have a small code footprint. It
        should be quick and easy to to understand what the library is doing and
        why, based on common entry points like included CGI scripts. Where
        possible, dynamic programming “magic” is to be avoided, in favor of
        basic, procedural and copiously-documented Python.
    </p>

    <h3>Pluggable</h3>

    <p>
        We want to accept plug-ins and extensions from outside TileStache, and
        offer TileStache itself as an extension for other systems. It must be
        possible to write and use additional caches or renderers without having
        to modify the core package itself, extend classes from inside the
        package, or navigate chains of class dependencies. Duck typing and
        stable interfaces win.
    </p>

    <h3>Sensible Defaults</h3>

    <p>
        The default action of a configured TileStache instance should permit
        the most common form of interaction: a worldwide, spherical-mercator
        upper-left oriented tile layout compatible with those used by
        OpenStreetMap, Google, Bing Maps, Yahoo! and others. It should be
        possible to make TileStache do whatever is necessary to support any
        external system, but we eschew complex, impenetrable standards in favor
        of pragmatic, fast utility with basic web clients.
