.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBtilestache-seed\fR command.
.PP
\fBtilestache-seed\fR seeds a single layer in your TileStache configuration.
No images are returned, but TileStache ends up with a pre-filled cache.
Bounding box is given as a pair of lat/lon coordinates, e.g. "37.788
\-122.349 37.833 \-122.246". Output is a list of tile paths as they are
created.
.br
Configuration, BBox, and Layer options are required.
