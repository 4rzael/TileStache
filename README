A stylish alternative for caching your tiles.

TileStache is a Python-based server application that can serve up map tiles
based on rendered geographic data. You might be familiar with TileCache
(http://tilecache.org), the venerable open source WMS server from MetaCarta.
TileStache is similar, but we hope simpler and better-suited to the needs of
designers and cartographers.
